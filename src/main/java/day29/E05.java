    What is the difference between "Exception" and "Error"?
    "Exception"s can be handled, your app can work after handling Exception.
    "Error"s can be handled, your app can not work after getting error.
    NOt: Exceptions and errors are child of "throwable".
    Common Errors: i) OutOfMemory: It occurs Ä±f the Heap Memory is full.
                    ii) StackOverFlowError: It occurs if the Stack Memory is full.
                    iii) Linkage Error: It occurs if the "dependent" class has any issue.

                    Custom Exception: We can create our own Exception Classes, they can be "Checked"(CTE) or "Unchecked"(Run Time) exception.
                                        i) To be able to create custom Exception gives us flexibility.
                                        ii) To be able to create custom Exception, protect the aplication from the developer mistakes.
